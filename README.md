### Network Failure Interfaces Challenge
### First Place Project

Worked on a team with Alex Curtiss (https://github.com/apccurtiss)

This project focuses on detecting unreported failures in a network. It does this by sending tracerouted packets through all available paths through a network, and comparing which packets fail to reach their destination to determine which link is dropping packets. The code then sends this to a locally hosted Javascript graph of the network, which turns the broken connection on the graph red.
